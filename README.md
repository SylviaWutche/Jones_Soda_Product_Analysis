# Reducing Downtime & Improving Production Efficiency at Jones Soda  

## 1. Introduction  

Jones Soda has built its brand on high-quality beverages, but behind the scenes, production challenges are slowing things down. Machines break down unexpectedly, adjustments are frequent, and valuable production time is lost.  

The numbers tell the story:  
📉 **1,388 minutes of total downtime**—more than 23 hours of lost production.  
⚠️ **1,027 minutes (74%) caused by the top recurring issues.**  
🔧 **Frequent machine adjustments are leading to machine failures**, making the problem even worse.  

The goal? **Cut downtime by 50%**, recover lost batches, and get production running smoothly again.

## 2. Where Are We Losing Time?  

Downtime isn't just a pause in production—it’s a chain reaction. The more adjustments operators make, the higher the risk of failure. We analyzed downtime data and identified **three major problem areas:**  

### **Key Problem Areas & Impact**  

| **Issue** | **Downtime (mins)** | **% of Total Downtime** | **Effect on Production** |
|------------|--------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| **Machine Failures** (Breakdowns) | 611 mins | 44% | Sudden stoppages, lost batches |
| **Frequent Machine Adjustments** | 416 mins | 30% | Causes instability, leading to failures |
| **Batch Change Delays** | 277 mins | 20% | Inefficient transitions between products |

🚨 **The biggest problem? Machine adjustments often cause machine failures.** Instead of fixing the issue, they make it worse!

## 3. Root Cause Analysis  

Let's break down the **worst offenders**—the products experiencing the most downtime and why.  

### **Top Products Affected by Downtime**  

| **Product** | **Total Downtime (mins)** | **% of Total Downtime** | **Batch Failure Rate (%)** | **Primary Issue** |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| **CO-600** | 494 mins | 35.59% | 93.33% | Machine failure (caused by adjustments) |
| **CO-2L** | 277 mins | 19.96% | 100% | Machine adjustments |
| **RB-600** | 258 mins | 18.58% | 100% | Machine adjustments |
| **LE-600** | 169 mins | 12.17% | 83.33% | Batch change delays |
| **DC-600** | 115 mins | 8.29% | 75% | Machine failure |
| **OR-600** | 75 mins | 5.40% | 100% | Batch change delays |

🚧 **CO-600 is the biggest bottleneck, responsible for over 35% of downtime.**  
🛠️ **Machine adjustments are a major issue—causing failures instead of fixing them.**

## 4. The Plan: Reducing Downtime by 50%  

To get production back on track, we focus on **three key fixes**:  

✅ **Preventive Maintenance:** Regular servicing to stop failures before they happen.  
✅ **Machine Optimization:** Fine-tuning settings to reduce unnecessary adjustments.  
✅ **Operator Training:** Teaching teams to adjust machines correctly without causing breakdowns.  

### **Expected Gains from Fixes**  

| **Fix** | **Products Affected** | **Expected Downtime Reduction** | **Batches Recovered** |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **Preventive Maintenance** | CO-600, DC-600 | ~50% fewer failures | 4 batches |
| **Machine Optimization** | CO-2L, RB-600 | ~50% fewer adjustments | 3 batches |
| **Batch Change Process Improvement** | LE-600, OR-600 | Faster transitions | Reduced downtime |

🚀 **Total downtime reduction: 8+ hours (~50% improvement).**  
📦 **Recovered batches: 7 additional batches.**  
⚡ **More stable, efficient production.**
