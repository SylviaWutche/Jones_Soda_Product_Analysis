# Reducing Downtime & Improving Production Efficiency at Jones Soda  

## 1. Introduction  

Jones Soda has built its brand on high-quality beverages, but behind the scenes, production challenges are slowing things down. Machines break down unexpectedly, adjustments are frequent, and valuable production time is lost.  

The numbers tell the story:  
 **1,388 minutes of total downtime**â€”more than 23 hours of lost production 
 **1,027 minutes (74%) caused by the top recurring issues**  
 **Frequent machine adjustments are leading to machine failures**, making the problem even worse

The goal? **Cut downtime by 50%**, recover lost batches, and get production running smoothly again.

## 2. Where are we losing time?  

Downtime isn't just a pause in productionâ€”itâ€™s a chain reaction. The more adjustments operators make, the higher the risk of failure. We analyzed downtime data and identified **three major problem areas:**  

### **Key Problem Areas & Impact**  

| **Issue** | **Downtime (mins)** | **% of Total Downtime** | **Effect on Production** |
|------------|--------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| **Machine Failures** (Breakdowns) | 611 mins | 44% | Sudden stoppages, lost batches |
| **Frequent Machine Adjustments** | 416 mins | 30% | Causes instability, leading to failures |
| **Batch Change Delays** | 277 mins | 20% | Inefficient transitions between products |

ðŸš¨ **The biggest problem? Machine adjustments often cause machine failures.** Instead of fixing the issue, they make it worse!

## 3. Root Cause Analysis  

Let's break down the **worst offenders**â€”the products experiencing the most downtime and why.  

### **Top Products Affected by Downtime**  

| **Product** | **Total Downtime (mins)** | **% of Total Downtime** | **Batch Failure Rate (%)** | **Primary Issue** |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| **CO-600** | 494 mins | 35.59% | 93.33% | Machine failure (caused by adjustments) |
| **CO-2L** | 277 mins | 19.96% | 100% | Machine adjustments |
| **RB-600** | 258 mins | 18.58% | 100% | Machine adjustments |
| **LE-600** | 169 mins | 12.17% | 83.33% | Batch change delays |
| **DC-600** | 115 mins | 8.29% | 75% | Machine failure |
| **OR-600** | 75 mins | 5.40% | 100% | Batch change delays |

 **CO-600 is the biggest bottleneck, responsible for over 35% of downtime**  
 **Machine adjustments are a major issueâ€”causing failures instead of fixing them**

## 4. The Plan: Reducing downtime by 50%  

To get production back on track, we focus on **three key fixes**:  

1. **Preventive Maintenance:** Regular servicing to stop failures before they happen
2. **Machine Optimization:** Fine-tuning settings to reduce unnecessary adjustments
3. **Operator Training:** Teach operators to adjust machines correctly without causing breakdowns  

### **Expected Gains from Fixes**  

| **Fix** | **Products Affected** | **Expected Downtime Reduction** | **Batches Recovered** |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **Preventive Maintenance** | CO-600, DC-600 | ~50% fewer failures | 4 batches |
| **Machine Optimization** | CO-2L, RB-600 | ~50% fewer adjustments | 3 batches |
| **Batch Change Process Improvement** | LE-600, OR-600 | Faster transitions | Reduced downtime |

 **Total downtime reduction: 8+ hours (~50% improvement)**  
 **Recovered batches: 7 additional batches**  
 **More stable, efficient production**

## 5. Business Impact: Why this matters  

This isnâ€™t just about fixing machinesâ€”itâ€™s about **getting more done in less time**  

âœ… **Higher Efficiency** â€“ Up to **20% more output** from the same machines.  
âœ… **Lower Costs** â€“ Fewer breakdowns = fewer repairs.  
âœ… **Less Waste** â€“ Fewer failed batches = higher profit

---

## 6. Action Plan  

ðŸ”¹ **Immediate Fixes (Next 30 Days)**  
âœ… Implement **preventive maintenance** for CO-600.  
âœ… Adjust **CO-2L and RB-600 settings** to minimize frequent stops.  
âœ… Train operators to **reduce unnecessary machine adjustments**

ðŸ”¸ **Ongoing Strategy (Quarterly Check-ins)**  
1. **Monitor downtime trends** and adjust plans as needed 
2. **Service machines regularly** to prevent breakdowns
3. **Optimize batch change processes** to keep production flowing

## 7. Conclusion: A More Efficient Future  

By addressing downtime at its root cause, Jones Soda can:  

1.  **Save 8+ hours of production time**  
2. **Recover 7 lost batches**  
3. **Reduce machine failures and improve long-term efficiency**  

The solution is clear: **Stop unnecessary adjustments, maintain machines, and optimize processes**  

ðŸ’¡ **"Efficiency isnâ€™t just about working fasterâ€”itâ€™s about working smarter"**
